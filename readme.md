### Work with ThreeJs and lineMP

a simple project with ThreeJs and the Medium Point algorithm


### How does it work

navigate with the mouse to a point in the plan, click the `X` key once to mark the start of the line, navigate to the next point, click the `X` key to draw a line from the starting point and draw the path using the lineMP

press `Backspace` key to clear all lines on the plan

### Unit tests

lineMP has unit tests so one can change it and make sure it does not change the result

run `npm test` in order to execute them
